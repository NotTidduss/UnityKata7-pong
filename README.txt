Unity Kata #7 - Pong

What is Pong?
Pong is a two-dimensional sports game that simulates table tennis. 
The player controls an in-game paddle 
by moving it vertically across the left or right side of the screen. 
They can compete against another player controlling a second paddle 
on the opposing side. 
Players use the paddles to hit a ball back and forth.
